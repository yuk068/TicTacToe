# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe game with Swing GUI and a bot made in java

A test for my first ever bot, which uses minimax algorithm with alpha beta prunning, you can try the game by navigating to /src/app, from there you can click on TicTacToe.jar / execute run.vbs or open the terminal and type java -jar TicTacToe.jar

You can review the source code in /src/tictactoe

Thanks for checking it out!
